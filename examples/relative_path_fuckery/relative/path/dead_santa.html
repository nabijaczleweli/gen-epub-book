&emsp;"<em>Fuck</em>, this one was supposed to be Othala, not Jera!"<br />
"Well, it's too late now... Run for your goddamn lives!"<br />
"What about the old man? Won't he get mad?"<br />
"Whatever he'll do to us is better than what this one's gonna do if we don't run now. Now get a move on, you two!"

<p class="writing">
&emsp;"Where are the cherubs? Haven't heard them in a while."<br />
"Oh, they're out summoning Stan; that's what they told <em>me</em>, anyway.<!--"-->
  They get so lonely in the season, wouldn'<!--'-->t you say?
  Hard for them to get a friend anywhere close to <em>here</em>, eh?"<!--"-->
  <em>*Sigh.*</em><br />
"Well, as long as they're having fun..."

<p class="writing">
&emsp;"Check who lives there, I remember his neighbourhood being pretty terrible."<br />
"You're right. More than you'd ever want to."<br />
<em>*Encouraging silence.*</em><br />
"We got..." <em>*Deep breath.*</em> "Satan."<br />
"What the fuck should we do <em>now</em>? Tell the old man? He'll kill us."<br />
"Well, so will goddamn <em>Satan</em> if we don't get away from here <em>now</em>."<br />

"<em>Hush!</em> What's that?"<br />
"Can't hear anything..."<br />
"By the nine... Stay here. Better yet, hide somewhere smell-proof!"
</p>
<p class="writing">
&emsp;"So, we meet again, old 'friend'."<br />
"<em>You were hiding right. Not anymore. Your death is imminent.</em>"<br />
"Would it surprise you to hear that I learned a couple of tricks, too?"
</p>
<p class="writing">
&emsp;"Old man's tricks didn't do him much good, did they?"<br />
"Not much you can do when your opponent moves faster than you can perceive it<!--"-->
  and interrupts the old-as-world clich√© of pre-decisive-battle hero-villain conversation, is there?"<!--"--><br />
"At least he killed the thing..."<br />
"...but it mutilated him first. Let's get out of here. Shit makes me queasy."
