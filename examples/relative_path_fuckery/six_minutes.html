&emsp;"'Ello, luv! What can do for ya'?"<br />
<em>Pfft.</em> "Drop the damn pretense. Glad you're here. Pass me that pouch, would ya'?"<br />
"Heavy stuff; what's in there? 'Новинки'<a href="#asterix1">*</a>?"<br />
"Heh, look at this one, for example." <em>*Metal-metal clang.* *Click.* *Metal-metal clang.*</em> "Ready? Observe!" <em>*Explosion.*</em><br />
"What happened to that guy's <em>face</em>?"<br />
"Oh, y'know. It just kind of... ceased to exist."<br />
"What's <em>in</em> these rounds?"<br />
"Oh, various things. Observe!" <em>*Metal-metal clang.* *Click.* *Metal-metal clang.* *Explosion.*</em><br />
"That tank... just..."<br />
"Exploded, yes."<br />
"But you're not supposed to be able to do that with a <em>bullet</em>."<br />
"Those are not ordinary rounds. They're manufactured by our capitalist 'friends' over in America.<!--"-->
 That'<!--'-->s what they call an '<!--'-->ayy-pee-aii'<!--'-->, I think that stands for Armour-Piercing-Incendiary?"<!--"--><br />
"It pierces even tank-grade armour?"<br />
"Clearly, yes. But you came here to discuss...?"<br />
"You. Me. Us."<br />
"Oh?" <em>*Explosion.*</em><br />
"You can stop accenting everything you say by shooting your rifle, y'know?"<br />
"Fine." <em>*Explosion.* Giggle.</em> "A'ight, I'll stop. You were saying..."<br />
"Yes, us."<br />
<em>*Encouraging silence.* *Explosion.*</em><br />
"We can't stay here. Not for much longer, anyway. You <em>know</em> what they do to the likes of us, and they're growing suspicious already."<br />
"You can rule me out of the equa-" <em>*Explosion.*</em> "-tion."<br />
"Why? What's happened, luv? I thought you joined the army, and I followed, to finance our escape to your, as you called them,<!--"-->
 capitalist '<!--'-->friends'<!--'--> over in the Americas."<!--"--><br />
"Well, yes. That <em>was</em> the plan at the time. And still <em>is</em> for you. As for me..." <em>*Explosion.*</em> "Good shit.<!--"-->
 ...as for me, I can'<!--'-->t do that."<!--"--><br />
"Why, love? What happened? Can I help?"<br />
"Guessing that's one way to break the news to you. I'm dying. I'm practically dead as is. Cancer, terminal. The doctor gave me a month or two.<!--"-->
 Increasing calcification, first of..." <em>*Explosion.*</em> "Meh. ...first of the skeleton, originating in my right shoulder,
 then spreading all the way to my brain<a href="#asterix2">**</a>, and that'<!--'-->s probably what'<!--'-->s gonna kill me."<!--"--><br />
<em>Sobbing.</em> "No way to save you?"<br />
"Nah, I enlisted with the army because if I die here it'll be probably less painful than what'd occur 'naturally'." <em>*Explosion.*</em><br />
<em>Deepened sobbing.</em><br />
"Oh come on, not even a faint smile for that?" <em>Sigh.</em> "I have a plan for you. After I die and your deployment ends you take my money,<!--"-->
 you have the account details, right?"<!--"--><br />
<em>Nod.</em><br />
"You take my money, you should have enough, fly to America and find yourself a nice lass, alright?"<br />
"Y- yes."<br />
<em>Growl.</em> "Goddammit, soldier! How are you to respond to a higher-ranked officer!" <em>*Explosion.*</em><br />
<em>Faint smile.</em> "<strong>Yes, sir!</strong>"<br />
"I knew I could get something out of you t'day. Gimme a hug and run. Save yourself. They've broken through our defences.<!--"-->
 Tell the others that I say that we won'<!--'-->t hold up much longer."<br /><!--"-->
<em>*Hugging.*</em> "I love you."<br />
"I know. Now <em><strong>GO</strong></em>! See you in hell!"<br />
<em>Reassured. Determined.</em> "Make Satan sorry he's met you!" <em>*Distant sound of bootsteps.*</em><br />
<em>*Brass clatters in a leather pouch.*</em>

I took the liberty of considering nonverbal parts of a conversation "dialogue", too.
